   <p> Hello everybody! My name is Kyerra. I am going into front-end web developer
    and hoping to get my Bachlors degree in it. I am a 21 year old single lady.
    I decided to do web design because it is something that I enjoy doing.
    I love to read my favorite book series is The Mortal Instruments by Cassandra
    Clare. The first book is The City of Bones. I also love to garden but have not
    started this year yet because it is still to cold. I also love to draw
    and to color. I love to be creative in my own way and create different
    things to go with that.
   </p>
